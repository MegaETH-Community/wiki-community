# User Guide

This section explains how users can interact with the **MegaETH** ecosystem. Learn how to connect your wallet to the chain, access tools and projects, explore dApps, understand how to earn rewards, and navigate Discord roles.

**Fluffle NFT Opportunities**

There are still **5,000 Fluffle NFTs** available to be distributed! These exclusive NFTs provide special access and perks within the MegaETH community. The distribution focuses on rewarding active participants and contributors to the ecosystem:

* **Phase 2 (Proactive)**: The remaining 5,000 NFTs will be distributed to teams and communities that make up the **Mega Mafia**, with each team receiving portions to distribute to their respective communities
* **Social engagement rewards**: A portion will be reserved for users through social media analysis and community participation
* **Community-driven allocation**: The majority will be distributed by teams themselves, creating opportunities for active community members

Want to get involved? Start with our [Onboarding](onboarding.md) guide to set up your wallet and get familiar with the ecosystem, then dive into our [Exploring](hunting.md) section with the hunting guide to discover projects and increase your chances of earning a Fluffle NFT!
