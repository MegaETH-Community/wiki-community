**2. MegaMafia 2.0: The Premier Accelerator Program**.

**MegaMafia 2.0** was launched on [April 24th](https://x.com/0xMegaMafia/status/1915073541705179305) as the second cohort! This intensive accelerator program focuses on what truly matters: **applications over infrastructure**.

**Program Overview:**

* **Focus**: Accelerating ecosystem-defining applications rather than infrastructure projects
* **Structure**: Year-long program with 15 teams across 3 locations
* **Approach**: In-person collaboration, shared experiences, and intense 0-1 focus

**Core Philosophy:** The program operates on the thesis that the space is oversaturated with infrastructure, while few focus on accelerating what truly matters: applications. MegaETH's performance capabilities are meaningless without exceptional applications to utilize them.

Participants work directly with the MegaETH core team, MegaMafia alumni, and advisors to build applications that can only exist on a real-time blockchain.

**MegaMafia 1.0: Proven Success** The original MegaMafia program laid the foundation for MegaETH's ecosystem and proved the accelerator model works:

* **$40M+ raised** by participating teams, surpassing MegaETH's own funding
* **Notable projects**: Noise, GTE, CapMoney, Euphoria, and other ecosystem leaders
* **Investor backing**: Franklin Templeton, Robot Ventures, Maven 11, Figment Capital
* **Legacy**: These OG Mafia pioneers shaped the early vision and demonstrated that focused application development drives real ecosystem value. Members hold the exclusive **OG Mafia** role in the Discord community.
