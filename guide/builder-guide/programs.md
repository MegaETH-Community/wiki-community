#### **2. MegaMafia 2.0: The Premier Accelerator Program**.

MegaETH's flagship accelerator bringing exceptional builders together to create **zero-to-one applications** only possible with 100k TPS and sub-millisecond block times. Teams co-work and co-live with the core team at intensive builder residencies worldwide.

**Program Evolution**

* **MegaMafia 1.0** - Proven foundation that supercharged existing primitives by leveraging MegaETH's increased bandwidth, reduced latency, and larger contract sizes
  * **$40M+ raised** by participating teams, surpassing MegaETH's own funding
  * Notable projects: Noise, GTE, CapMoney, Euphoria - ecosystem leaders backed by Franklin Templeton, Robot Ventures, Maven 11, Figment Capital
  * OG Mafia pioneers shaped the early vision and demonstrated that focused application development drives real ecosystem value
* **MegaMafia 2.0** - Launched [April 24th](https://x.com/0xMegaMafia/status/1915073541705179305) with broader scope and deeper creativity
  * Challenge builders to imagine **product spaces outside conventional thinking**
  * Focus on apps that **formalize existing loops instead of manufacturing new demand**
  * Take fragmented day-to-day behaviors and distill them into coherent flows that unlock new connections
* **Philosophy**
  * Inspired by **A24's creative approach** - curated by taste and authenticity, not categories
  * Applications over infrastructure - the space is oversaturated with infra while few focus on what truly matters
  * You know it's Mafia-built because you _feel it_
* **Builder Residencies**
  * **Month-long immersive experiences** from Berlin to Copenhagen to Chiang Mai
  * High-bandwidth environments where ideas grow faster and conviction compounds
  * Work, debug, and debate together - these offsites are the program's lifeblood
* **Who Builds Here**
  * Former FANG/Web2 builders, **DeFi 2020 veterans**, **HFT traders**, fresh graduates, and **2015 OGs**
  * All building apps **only possible on MegaETH** - next-gen DeFi, Autonomous Worlds, consumer apps with emotional value
  * **Mafia helps Mafia** - real collaboration and camaraderie with direct access to core team and alumni

**Backing** - **$75M+** from Paradigm, Dragonfly, Franklin Templeton, Maven11, Robot Ventures, and leading crypto visionaries
