# Builder Guide

This is your **starting point** to understand why MegaETH is the ideal platform for developers ready to **shape the future** of decentralized applications. They’re building a **World Computer**, a global, single state machine designed to deliver applications that outperform anything available today. By choosing MegaETH, you’re not just coding on a blockchain; you’re helping construct a **new civilization**.

***

**Why Build on MegaETH?**

MegaETH stands out as a top platform for developers. Here’s why:

* **Unmatched Performance**: With sub-10 millisecond block times and the capacity for up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), MegaETH delivers near-instant, low-fee transactions. No more network congestion or sluggish execution, applications can run smoothly and efficiently.
* **Scalability Without Limits**: Its architecture is built to handle diverse, demanding use cases, from finance to robotics, without sacrificing speed or affordability.
* **Frontiers of Innovation**: MegaETH opens the door to groundbreaking possibilities across multiple domains:
  * **DeFi**: Achieve real-time price discovery, tighter spreads, and capital efficiency that rivals centralized systems, potentially making permissioned finance obsolete.
  * **DePIN**: Power decentralized infrastructure, like ride-sharing or energy grids, with real-time coordination and competitive performance.
  * **AI**: Support the rise of AI agents that transact and coordinate at scale, unconstrained by gas limits or blockspace scarcity.
  * **Robotics**: Enable autonomous machine economies with trustless, transparent coordination in dynamic real-world environments.
  * **Gaming**: Create fully onchain gaming experiences with the tick rates and throughput needed for real-time gameplay.
  * **Social**: Leverage abundant blockspace to store and process non-financial data, paving the way for decentralized knowledge graphs and next-gen social apps.
* **A Thriving Civilization**: MegaETH isn’t just a blockchain, it’s envisioned as a **Mega Civilization**. It’s a community driven by innovation, performance, and a shared passion for bringing delightful design to crypto.

Builders are the ones who can destigmatize crypto, deliver financial and emotional value to users, and turn the World Computer thesis into reality. Without builders, there’s no MegaETH.
