# MegaLabs

**Mega Labs** represents a collective of specialists dedicated to optimizing blockchain performance and advancing the **World Computer** concept. Their mission focuses on designing a cutting-edge execution layer that separates execution from consensus, leveraging Ethereum as a settlement layer. By utilizing hyper-specialized node architecture, Mega Labs pushes the limits of performance, constrained only by the capabilities of hardware.

### The Expertise Behind Mega Labs

The foundation of MegaETH dates back to **2022**, when **Yilong Li**, completing his PhD in low-latency data center computing at Stanford, conceptualized the project. His expertise in high-performance systems paved the way for the platformâ€™s core architecture.

Joining him was **Lei Yang**, whose research at MIT in blockchain consensus and networking added depth to the technical framework. To solidify the strategic direction, **Shuyao Kong**, a former leader in global business development at Consensys, became the final co-founder.&#x20;

Together, this team reflects a rare convergence of **technical mastery** and **practical vision**, delivering solutions that **directly address the challenges** of next-generation blockchain systems.
