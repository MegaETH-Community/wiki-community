# Just Another L2?

With **dozens of Layer-2 solutions** (L2s) claiming to revolutionize the blockchain space—and new Layer-1 (L1) platforms emerging constantly—it’s fair to ask: **Is MegaETH just another L2?** In reality, there’s much more to it. Before diving into **why** MegaETH stands apart, let’s take a step back and look at the **broader context**:

1. **How do blockchains actually work?**\
   They rely on a **consensus mechanism** (how nodes agree on the network’s “truth”) and a process for **executing transactions** (updating the global state).
2. **What challenges do blockchains face?**\
   From **limited throughput** to **duplicated work** on every node, there are clear bottlenecks that slow down existing L1 and L2 solutions.
3. **How can these challenges be solved?**\
   Techniques like **node specialization**, **optimized execution environments**, or new approaches to **distributed consensus** can help push the performance envelope.

In the subsections below, we’ll break down **what blockchains are** and **where they fall short.** For a deeper dive into **how MegaETH solves these challenges** and delivers real-time performance without compromising decentralization, head to the [**Deep Dive**](../../deep-dive/architecture/) section.&#x20;

By the end of these sections, you’ll see **why MegaETH isn’t “just another L2,”** but a **real-time blockchain** that redefines on-chain performance. Dive in to learn more!
