# 1. Consensus & Execution

Blockchains combine **consensus**—how nodes agree on the order of new blocks—and **execution**—how transactions in those blocks are processed to update the global state. Understanding these two components is crucial for grasping both the **strengths** and **limitations** of many Layer-1 (L1) networks and, by extension, how Layer-2 (L2) solutions like MegaETH push performance further.

***

### Consensus: Ordering Transactions

Consensus protocols determine which transactions are valid and in what order they should appear on the blockchain. While there are many variations, most fall into two broad categories:

1. **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**
   * Miners compete by expending computational resources to solve cryptographic puzzles.
   * Example: Bitcoin’s Nakamoto consensus.
2. **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) & BFT-Style Protocols**
   * Validators are chosen based on their stake (i.e., the tokens they hold) to propose and confirm new blocks.
   * Example: Ethereum’s PoS, which leverages Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) concepts to finalize blocks.

Despite different consensus algorithms, the **core idea** remains the same: nodes must reach an agreement on the **next valid block** while maintaining security and resisting censorship.

> This principle underpins the design of most consensus mechanisms: keep hardware requirements modest enough that anyone can verify the chain.

### Execution: Updating the State

Once a block is approved, every node **executes** the block’s transactions in order, updating the “state” (e.g., account balances, contract data). This process is analogous to having a **global CPU**:

1. **State**: Represents the blockchain’s current data (accounts, balances, contract storage).
2. **Transactions**: Requests to modify that state (sending tokens, calling smart contracts, etc.).
3. **Execution Environment**: Enforces the logic of transactions and updates the state accordingly (e.g., the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM).

In most L1s (like Ethereum), **every node** participates in both consensus and full execution. This design keeps the network secure, but also **duplicates work** across thousands of machines, leading to performance bottlenecks.

***

### Why Is This a Bottleneck?

* **Redundancy**: Having all nodes run the same calculations ensures trustlessness but caps overall throughput.
* **Hardware Constraints**: If you raise block size or transaction throughput too high, you risk pricing out smaller nodes (they can’t keep up), reducing **decentralization**.

This trade-off has led to **L2 innovations** where tasks can be **specialized**—for example, a “sequencer” to order transactions and “provers” to handle cryptographic proofs. In MegaETH, we extend this logic further by **concentrating execution** to achieve real-time responsiveness, while still preserving the integrity and security guarantees that come from Ethereum’s backbone.

#### Key Takeaways

* **Consensus** decides the order of new blocks; **execution** processes those blocks’ transactions.
* Traditional L1s replicate work across all nodes, ensuring robust security but limiting performance.
* L2 solutions, including MegaETH, **specialize** certain node roles to scale throughput and reduce execution delays.
