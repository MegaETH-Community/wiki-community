# 3. Node Roles

In **Layer-1 (L1) blockchains**, every node typically performs **all** tasks: reaching consensus, ordering transactions, and executing them. While this design maximizes security and decentralization, it also **duplicates** a large amount of work—limiting overall throughput. **Layer-2 (L2) solutions** like **MegaETH** solve these bottlenecks by **specializing** node roles, allowing the network to handle many more transactions at significantly higher speeds.

***

### Why Specialize?

1. **Avoid Redundant Work**\
   In L1 systems, each node replays every transaction locally. L2s reduce this duplication by having specific nodes handle **transaction ordering** or **execution**, freeing other nodes from repeating the same steps.
2. **Embrace Heterogeneous Hardware**\
   By enabling nodes to focus on distinct tasks (e.g., cryptographic proofs, state sync, or transaction sequencing), L2s can leverage specialized hardware—GPUs, FPGAs, or even custom accelerators—without forcing all participants to upgrade.
3. **Maintain Decentralization**\
   Contrary to initial impressions, specialization doesn’t necessarily undermine decentralization. While some nodes have “heavier” roles, **proof commitments** and **periodic settlements** on an L1 ensure the system as a whole remains trust-minimized.

***

### Key Node Roles in L2 Architectures

Below are common node roles you’ll encounter in high-performance blockchains, including MegaETH:

#### 1. Sequencer (Leader)

* **What It Does**: Orders transactions and creates new blocks or batches.
* **Why It Matters**: Centralizing the ordering process dramatically **reduces latency**, allowing faster block times than L1. In MegaETH, the sequencer also handles **lightning-fast execution**, leveraging an optimized environment.

#### 2. Prover (ZK or Fraud-Proofs)

* **What It Does**: In many L2s (especially ZK-Rollups), provers generate cryptographic proofs to validate correct state updates.
* **Why It Matters**: Offloading this heavy math to dedicated nodes **frees the rest of the network** from expensive proof generation. MegaETH focuses on real-time **execution** rather than heavy ZK proofs but still maintains robust security checks.

#### 3. Full Nodes

* **What They Do**: Retain the blockchain’s **entire** state, verify blocks independently, and can replay transactions to confirm correctness.
* **Why They Matter**: Provide **checks and balances** on sequencer outputs. They also help **onboard** new or lagging nodes by feeding them the latest state data (state sync).

#### 4. Replica (or Light) Nodes

* **What They Do**: Maintain a pruned or partial version of the ledger—enough to validate most transactions without storing full historical data.
* **Why They Matter**: Offer **faster synchronization** and **lower hardware costs** for participants who just need timely updates, rather than full on-chain history.

#### 5. RPC Nodes

* **What They Do**: Act as **gateways** for user transactions, often hosting public APIs that wallets, dApps, or other systems connect to.
* **Why They Matter**: Simplify end-user interaction. Users don’t need to run a full node locally; instead, they rely on RPC nodes to relay transactions to the sequencer.

***

### The MegaETH Approach

While many L2s separate **consensus** (e.g., a minimal set of sequencer nodes) from **execution** (full node replication), **MegaETH** takes specialization further by **concentrating execution** as well. This allows:

* **Near-Instant Transactions**: Achieving **millisecond-level** responsiveness by eliminating much of the overhead seen in traditional EVM execution.
* **100,000+ TPS**: Tapping into hardware-level optimizations to scale well beyond standard Ethereum or rollup throughput.
* **Sustained Decentralization**: Despite increased specialization, regular users can still run nodes to independently verify the chain. State roots and commitments to Ethereum ensure a trust-minimized environment.

***

### Key Takeaways

* **Specialized Roles** (e.g., sequencer, prover) let L2s **drastically increase** performance compared to L1’s universal-node model.
* **Hardware Flexibility** ensures no single user is forced into expensive infrastructure while still benefiting from powerful nodes where needed.
* **MegaETH** employs advanced node specialization—both in **ordering** and **execution**—pushing blockchain performance to real-time levels without compromising on security or decentralization.
