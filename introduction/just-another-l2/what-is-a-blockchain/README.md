# What Is a Blockchain?

A **blockchain** is best thought of as a **distributed computer**, where multiple nodes work together to store and update data in a **trustless**, **append-only** manner. This structure offers a strong notion of digital ownership, public verifiability, and resistance to censorship—all without relying on a single authority.

Blockchain technology can be broken down into three core pillars:

1. **Cryptography**
   * **Public/Private Keys**: Prove ownership of digital assets or identities.
   * **Hashing**: Creates unique “fingerprints” for data and transactions, ensuring integrity and immutability.
2. **Distributed Ledger**
   * A **shared database** replicated on many computers around the world.
   * Organized as **blocks** in an “append-only” chain, where each block references the hash of the previous block.
3. **Consensus Protocol**
   * Ensures that **all nodes** agree on which blocks (and transactions) are added to the chain.
   * Often involves **selecting a leader** (e.g., a validator) to propose blocks and **voting** on the result.

By combining these elements, blockchains **remove the need for a central authority** to manage data or ownership. They also enable new paradigms—like decentralized finance (DeFi), secure data notarization, and robust token economies—that are otherwise difficult to implement using traditional databases.

### Subpage Roadmap

Because blockchain functionality and design can get complex, we’ve organized the details into subpages. Feel free to jump to any section that matches your interest or expertise:

1. **The Fundamentals: Consensus & Execution**\
   Learn how blockchains process transactions (execution) and maintain a shared state (consensus). This subpage delves into Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, BFT-style algorithms, and why these mechanisms matter.
2. **The Journey of a User Transaction**
   * **RPC Nodes** and how users interact with the network
   * **Sequencer or Leader** who orders transactions
   * **Execution**: How state updates occur once transactions are finalized\
     This section references a **figure** illustrating how your transaction travels from your wallet or application to the blockchain, detailing each node’s responsibilities.
3. **Node Roles & Specialization in L2 Solutions**
   * Why L1 blockchains often replicate work across all nodes
   * How L2s like MegaETH reduce redundancy by **specializing node tasks**
   * Insight into **sequencers**, **provers**, and **full nodes**\
     Discover how focusing on efficiency (e.g., specialized hardware, parallel execution) unlocks higher throughput and lower latency.
4. **State Synchronization & Gas Limits**
   * **State Sync**: Bringing new or lagging nodes up to speed with the latest state
   * **State Root Commitments** (e.g., MPT or other tries) and why they’re critical for light clients
   * **Block Gas Limit**: The artificial throttle that keeps the network stable\
     Understand why even major breakthroughs in one part of the system won’t matter if the gas limit or block time remains a bottleneck.

### Why Does It Matter?

1. **Unique Capabilities**\
   Blockchain technology enables trust-minimized systems for payments, asset ownership, and data management—capabilities that are **difficult to replicate** with traditional databases.
2. **Trade-Offs in L1 Design**\
   In many Layer-1 blockchains, each node does everything (consensus + execution). This **redundancy** ensures high security and censorship resistance but limits **throughput**.
3. **Layer-2 as an Evolution**\
   L2 solutions, including **MegaETH**, **specialize node roles** and optimize execution. By pushing tasks (e.g., transaction ordering or cryptographic proving) to specific nodes, L2s can **significantly enhance performance** while still benefiting from the security guarantees of the underlying L1.
