# What Is a Blockchain?

A **blockchain** is best thought of as a **distributed computer**, where multiple nodes work together to store and update data in a **trustless**, **append-only** manner—offering digital ownership, public verifiability, and censorship resistance without central authority.

**Three Core Pillars:**

1. **Cryptography**
   * **Public/Private Keys**: Prove ownership of digital assets or identities.
   * **Hashing**: Creates unique “fingerprints” for data and transactions, ensuring integrity and immutability.
2. **Distributed Ledger**
   * A **shared database** replicated on many computers around the world.
   * Organized as **blocks** in an “append-only” chain, where each block references the hash of the previous block.
3. **Consensus Protocol**
   * Ensures that **all nodes** agree on which blocks (and transactions) are added to the chain.
   * Involves **selecting a leader** (a validator) to propose blocks and **voting mechanisms**.

This combination enables **trust-minimized systems** for payments, DeFi, asset ownership, and data management—capabilities difficult to replicate with traditional databases.
