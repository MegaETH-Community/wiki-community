# 2. User Transaction

When you click “Send” or “Confirm” in your wallet, you’re kicking off a **multi-step process** that involves various nodes in the network—each with a specific role. Below is an overview of how a typical transaction flows, from the user’s device all the way to final settlement on the blockchain.

***

### 1. User & RPC Node

* **User (Wallet or dApp)**\
  You (the user) initiate a transaction—such as transferring tokens or interacting with a smart contract. Your wallet signs the transaction using your **private key**, creating a verifiable record of your intent.
* **RPC Node**\
  Your transaction is then sent to an **RPC node**, which serves as the entry point to the network. An RPC node could be:
  * A **Full Node** that maintains a complete copy of the blockchain’s data and can verify transactions independently.
  * A **Replica Node** (or a lighter version of a full node) that synchronizes state and relays transactions but may offload some tasks to full nodes.

> **Why RPC Nodes?**\
> They provide the **API endpoints** that dApps and wallets connect to, allowing your transaction to reach the blockchain. They also help reduce direct load on sequencer nodes.

***

### 2. Sequencer (Transaction Ordering)

* **Central Role of the Sequencer**\
  In many L2 designs, a **sequencer** (sometimes referred to as a “leader”) is responsible for deciding the **order** of incoming transactions. This role is critical for maintaining a consistent global state.
* **Batching & Packaging**\
  The sequencer collects transactions from various RPC nodes, batches them, and forms a **new block** (or batch). It then broadcasts this block to other nodes in the network.

> **Why a Specialized Sequencer?**\
> Traditional L1s require every node to agree on the transaction order. By delegating that job to a single or small set of sequencer nodes, an L2 can achieve **faster throughput**—at the cost of some added complexity to maintain trust (e.g., via proofs or periodic commitments on L1).

***

### 3. Execution & State Updates

* **Execution Environment**\
  Once transactions are ordered, the **execution environment** (like an EVM-compatible runtime) processes them sequentially (or in parallel, if the L2 supports it).
  * Smart contracts run their code.
  * Balances and states are updated accordingly.
* **State Commitment**\
  After all transactions in the block are executed, the L2 obtains a **new state root**—a cryptographic fingerprint that represents the entire updated state.

> **Performance Bottleneck**\
> Even if consensus is simplified, the network’s overall speed can be **capped by execution** (e.g., how fast nodes can process each transaction and update their states).

***

### 4. Broadcast & Finality

* **Network Broadcast**\
  The sequencer (and other nodes) broadcast the newly formed block, allowing **full nodes** to verify execution and **replica nodes** to synchronize their local data.
* **Settlement on L1**\
  Many L2s post periodic **state commitments**, transaction data, or proofs to an L1 (like Ethereum) to secure finality and leverage L1’s robust consensus. This serves as a **checkpoint**—if anything goes wrong on L2, users can rely on L1’s data to resolve disputes or recover funds.

> **State Sync**\
> Bringing new or lagging nodes **up to speed** with the latest state is vital for high-performance networks. This process can be complex, particularly when transaction throughput is high.

***

### Putting It All Together

1. **User** creates and signs a transaction.
2. **RPC Node** receives it and forwards it to the L2’s network.
3. **Sequencer** orders the transaction in a block, then executes (or delegates execution to specialized nodes).
4. **Full/Replica Nodes** verify the block, keep a local copy of the updated state, and broadcast it further.
5. **Settlement** occurs when the block or proof is anchored on an L1 chain, ensuring strong security guarantees.

***

#### Key Takeaways

* **RPC Nodes** offer the user-facing gateway to the blockchain.
* **Sequencers** or “leaders” play a pivotal role in quickly ordering transactions—something that can significantly improve performance over traditional L1 designs.
* **Execution** and **state updates** remain a bottleneck if not optimized, especially under high throughput.
* **Final Settlement** on an L1 is crucial for maintaining decentralization and security guarantees.
