# Overview

Blockchains are complex systems with interconnected components, where solving one bottleneck often creates another. Scaling a blockchain to support real-time performance requires a **holistic and principled approach** that addresses all critical limitations simultaneously. MegaETH adopts this methodology, combining deep performance analysis with innovative solutions to ensure meaningful and lasting improvements.

The following diagram highlights the **key challenges** that blockchains face in achieving real-time performance and outlines **MegaETH's dual-pronged strategy** to address them:

1. **Node Specialization**: Leveraging tailored hardware setups to eliminate bottlenecks in state access and transaction processing.
2. **Hyper-Optimizing the EVM**: Implementing cutting-edge techniques like in-memory computing, bytecode compilation, and parallel execution to unlock the full potential of blockchain infrastructure.

While **node specialization** provides a strong foundation for real-time performance, it cannot fully address the inefficiencies of traditional execution environments. Issues such as Merkle Patricia Trie updates, interpreter overhead, and limited parallelism continue to hinder scalability, even with high-end hardware.

To overcome these challenges, the second pillar, **Hyper-Optimizing the EVM**, introduces innovative techniques that transform the execution layer, addressing inefficiencies in modern blockchain software that prevent full utilization of hardware capabilities. This gap arises from several key challenges:

1. **High State Access Latency**:
   * Traditional EVM implementations rely heavily on SSDs, introducing latency for state access operations like `sload`.
   * **Solution**: In-memory computing eliminates this bottleneck by storing the entire blockchain state in RAM, leveraging abundant server memory.
2. **Lack of Parallel Execution**:
   * Sequential processing limits throughput, as transactions are executed one at a time.
   * **Solution**: Two-pronged parallel execution enables efficient block production and validation, avoiding limitations like cascading aborts in Block-STM.
3. **Interpreter Overhead**:
   * EVM bytecode interpretation introduces significant inefficiencies, slowing execution by up to 1000x compared to native code.
   * **Solution**: Bytecode compilation (e.g., JIT) converts EVM bytecode into machine-native instructions, drastically improving performance.

In addition to these generic challenges, **real-time blockchains** like MegaETH face two unique demands:

4. **High-Frequency Block Production**:
   * Real-time systems require blocks to be produced consistently, often every 10 milliseconds.
   * **Solution**: Streaming EVM provides a co-designed pipeline that operates asynchronously, achieving 1-ms block times and fast transaction propagation.
5. **Transaction Prioritization During Congestion**:
   * Critical transactions must bypass queues during peak congestion to ensure responsiveness.
   * **Solution**: Parallel execution with prioritized transaction processing enables low-latency handling, even under heavy loads.

By approaching the problem comprehensively, MegaETH ensures that all components work harmoniously to deliver a **high-throughput, low-latency blockchain** capable of supporting next-generation applications.
