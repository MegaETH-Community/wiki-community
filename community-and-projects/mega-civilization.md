# Mega Civilization

The MegaETH ecosystem thrives thanks to a vibrant and growing community of builders, thinkers, and dreamers. It’s more than just a network—it’s a **civilization** in the making.

MegaETH is a foundation for a new kind of on-chain economy, where all activities can afford to live entirely on-chain. This opens vast possibilities for economic coordination, discovery of new marketplaces, and the growth of agentic creations. It’s a civilization united around shared values:

* The **World Computer thesis** as a call to action.
* The relentless pursuit of **performance singularity**.
* The belief in **delightful design** in crypto.
* The unapologetic spirit of the **MegaMafia**.

This is a community shaped by its contributors: builders, philosophers, craftsmen, artists, plunderers, and distant travelers. Together, they’re fostering a culture of innovation, collaboration, and a shared purpose to grow and expand MegaETH’s ecosystem.
