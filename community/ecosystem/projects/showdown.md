# Showdown

**Showdown reinvents high-stakes card gaming by merging poker's betting mechanics with the strategic depth of TCGs (Trading Card Game).** Created by world-ranked champions from Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone, it's designed to bring back the golden era of competitive poker—but with action cards that flip the game on its head.

### Team & Vision

**The Founders**

* [Stanislav Cifka](https://x.com/StanCifka) – Hearthstone world #1, Magic Pro Tour champion, chess FIDE master
* [Ondrej Strasky](https://x.com/OndrejStrasky) – Magic Pro League winner, Magic Mythic Championship winner
* Jan Kotrla – Magic National Champion, Magic Team World Championship 3rd place

**The Mission: Make Card Games Great Again**

_"20 years ago, poker was king. Then Hearthstone took over. Now it's time for the next big thing."_ Showdown aims to resurrect high-stakes competitive gaming by solving poker's modern problems: bots, regulatory fragmentation, and trust issues—all while keeping games fast, strategic, and accessible.

**Core Principles**

* **Game experience first** – No overcomplicated designs
* **Learn in 10 minutes** – Master over thousands of hours
* **Built for competition** – From casual play to million-dollar stakes

### How Showdown Works

**The Gameplay Loop**

Showdown takes poker's foundation and adds TCG mechanics:

* **7-10 minute matches** – Quick, mobile-friendly sessions
* **1v1 heads-up format** – Pure skill-based competition
* **2 private + 5 shared cards** – Classic poker structure
* **Action cards modify hands** – Replace weak cards, duplicate strong ones
* **First to 100 chips wins** – Dynamic scoring system

**Key Mechanics**

* **Check or Play** – Each turn, decide to progress or play action cards
* **Double Down** – Instead of folding, double the pot for a final showdown
* **Backfire Effects** – 50% chance mechanics add calculated risk
* **Colored Card Phases** – Different strategies for different game stages

_"Even if you start with a bad hand, you can play cards to improve it"_ – Unlike poker where you fold 90% of hands, Showdown ensures constant action and engagement.

### Technical Architecture

**Why Blockchain?**

[The founders explain](https://x.com/Mega_Ecosystem/status/1915546328760779000) how blockchain solves poker's biggest issues:

* **Permissionless play** – No country restrictions or regulatory barriers
* **Anti-bot design** – Action cards make algorithmic play impractical
* **Trust through transparency** – Smart contract tournaments with guaranteed payouts
* **True ownership** – NFT cards as collectible skins (gameplay cards free)

**MegaETH Integration**

With MegaETH's performance, Showdown enables:

* **Real-time betting markets** – Predict tournament winners mid-game
* **Instant settlements** – No waiting for withdrawals
* **On-chain tournaments** – Transparent, immutable prize pools
* **Community features** – Player-designed cards with on-chain voting

### Market Positioning

**The Problem with Modern Poker**

* **Banned in many countries** – US players can't face Europeans
* **Bot dominance** – AI beats pros since 2017
* **Trust issues** – Full Tilt's collapse still haunts players
* **Slow gameplay** – Folding 90% of hands kills excitement

**Showdown's Solution**

* **Global accessibility** – Blockchain bypasses regulations
* **Human-centric design** – Action cards defeat algorithmic play
* **Transparent infrastructure** – No custody, no trust required
* **Constant action** – Every hand matters, momentum swings frequently

### The Showdown Thesis

**Two-Sided Market**

* **Casual players** – Climb ladders, collect cards, enjoy quick matches
* **High-stakes players** – Bet millions in ego-driven skill battles
* **Not pay-to-win** – All gameplay cards free, NFTs are cosmetic only

**Competitive Vision**

Drawing from their professional backgrounds, the founders are building:

* **Regular seasons** with transparent rewards
* **eSports infrastructure** for tournaments
* **Streaming integration** with referral systems
* **6-player multiplayer** mode in development
