# World Capital Markets

**WCM unifies spot, perps, and lending into a single cross-margined exchange.** The first fully onchain platform where you can execute the most obvious DeFi trade – leveraged basis arbitrage – with just $10 starting capital.

### Team & Vision

The Founders

[Pogo Bounce](https://x.com/PogoB/status/1882097629854572544) and [Kevin Kap](https://x.com/0xKevinKap) are building WCM as part of the MegaETH ecosystem, working alongside the MegaMafia to create real long-term value in DeFi. Initially called Teko, now rebranded as World Capital Markets.

**The Mission: Democratize Arbitrage**

WCM aims to solve DeFi's most glaring inefficiency: the inability to execute simple cross-market arbitrage strategies that TradFi takes for granted. By unifying spot, perps, and lending under one roof with cross-margining, they're creating what they call "the only free lunch in finance."

**Why an Exchange, Not a Hedge Fund?**

The team draws inspiration from [LTCM's story](https://x.com/wcm_inc/status/1919447881771102483) – the legendary quant fund that controlled 5% of global markets before imploding. Their key insight:

* **Hedge funds are fragile** – Every additional dollar dilutes returns for all investors
* **Exchanges are network goods** – Every additional dollar strengthens the entire network
* **The goal:** Build a permissionless capital sink for all lending and funding markets in crypto

### How WCM Works

**The Leveraged Basis Trade** - [Source](https://x.com/wcm_inc/status/1917565143078109504)

Here's the trade that's impossible on current DeFi infrastructure:

* **Start with $10**
* **Borrow $90** (10x leverage)
* **Sell $50 ETH perps** (short)
* **Buy $50 ETH spot** (long)
* **Profit from funding rate arbitrage**

This simple strategy – capturing the spread between spot and futures prices – generates consistent returns in TradFi but requires unified infrastructure that DeFi lacks.

**Key Features**

* **Unified cross-margining** – Use the same collateral across all positions
* **All CLOBs** – Central limit order books for maximum efficiency
* **Fully onchain** – No centralized components or custody
* **Automated arbitrage** – Smart contracts enforce optimal rate discovery

### Technical Architecture

**The WCM Formula**

Just as Black-Scholes revolutionized options pricing, [WCM claims to have solved the "closed-form algebraic formula](https://x.com/wcm_inc/status/1919447881771102483)" for lending and futures rates in crypto. Unlike LTCM keeping their edge secret, WCM gives these returns to initial users to bootstrap liquidity.

**Infrastructure Requirements**

WCM's unified architecture demands extreme performance:

* **Instant settlement** – Cross-margining requires real-time position updates
* **High throughput** – Handle spot, perps, and lending orders simultaneously
* **Capital efficiency** – Enable 10x+ leverage without systemic risk
* **MegaETH deployment** – Only possible with sub-second finality

### Market Positioning

**Current DeFi Limitations**

* **Fragmented liquidity** – Spot on Uniswap, perps on dYdX, lending on Aave
* **No cross-margining** – Capital inefficient with separate collateral requirements
* **Performance bottlenecks** – Can't execute complex strategies onchain
* **High barriers** – Need significant capital to access arbitrage opportunities

**WCM's Solution**

* **Unified platform** – All products under one smart contract system
* **Capital efficient** – Start arbitraging with as little as $10
* **Permissionless access** – No minimum requirements or KYC
* **Network effects** – More users = better rates = more arbitrage opportunities

### The WCM Thesis

**Core Innovation**

By unifying spot, perps, and lending with cross-margining, WCM enables strategies that generate "free money" through market inefficiencies. The arbitrage opportunities will eventually compress, but in the process, WCM becomes the gravity well for all crypto lending and funding markets.

**Long-term Vision**

_"Leverage up and farm anything you want—anywhere it exists"_ – [WCM envisions](https://x.com/wcm_inc/status/1882095971678761062) a future where onchain lending truly rivals TradFi, without heavy collateral requirements or performance limitations.

***

**The Bottom Line:** WCM isn't just another DeFi protocol – it's the missing infrastructure that makes sophisticated trading strategies accessible to everyone. By solving the cross-margining problem and unifying all trading products onchain, they're creating a permissionless arbitrage machine that turns market inefficiencies into user profits.
