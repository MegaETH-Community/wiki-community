# Valhalla

**Valhalla** is building the first fully **on-chain and composable trading platform** on MegaETH, combining perps, spot trading, and lending in a single platform. Their mission: "Trade to own" - creating a community-driven exchange where users become genuine stakeholders.

### **Founder & Vision**

**Tiago** ([@tiagovalhalla](https://x.com/tiagovalhalla)) brings deep crypto experience spanning over a decade:

* **Early crypto adopter** - First interactions in 2012/2013, learning Bitcoin fundamentals
* **Technical expertise** - Background in software engineering with focus on formal verification
* **Proven builder** - Founded **Three Sigma** ([@threesigmaxyz](https://x.com/threesigmaxyz)), scaling from 0 to 50 people without external funding
* **Battle-tested trader** - Active participant since 2017/2018, experienced the full spectrum of crypto markets
* **Industry veteran** - Extensive work with L1s, L2s, DeFi protocols, conducting audits and risk modeling

Tiago's vision centers on **building products people genuinely want to use**, moving beyond theoretical DeFi toward practical, user-friendly infrastructure. ([tweet1](https://x.com/Mega_Ecosystem/status/1872730250590789810) | [tweet2](https://x.com/tiagovalhalla/status/1869414740348608593))

### **Community-First Approach**

Valhalla follows the **user-first tokenomics model** pioneered by projects like Hyperliquid, prioritizing community ownership over traditional VC-heavy structures. They recently secured **$1.5M in pre-seed funding** ([details](https://x.com/valhalla_defi/status/1870137202627489798)) while maintaining their community-focused approach.

**Key Community Initiatives:**

* **Fluffle NFT integration** - Leveraging MegaETH's 5,000+ Fluffle holders as core user base
* **Community-driven development** - Direct feedback loops shaping product roadmap
* **Collaborative ecosystem** - Projects within the "MegaMafia" supporting each other through shared liquidity and users
* **Early access programs** - Priority rollouts to aligned community members

This approach creates **genuine stakeholders** rather than passive speculators, fostering long-term engagement and organic growth.

### **Built for the MegaETH Ecosystem**

Valhalla's choice of MegaETH stems from both technical capabilities and ecosystem alignment, embodying the shift toward **community-driven finance**:

**Technical Advantages:**

* **Real-time architecture** - Enables true on-chain perps and CLOB functionality at practical speeds

**Ecosystem Benefits:**

* **Aligned community** - MegaETH's user-first tokenomics create natural synergies
* **Builder-focused network** - The "MegaMafia" provides collaborative support through shared resources
* **Shared mission** - Users become owners through meaningful participation, not speculation

As Tiago notes: _"MegaETH's infra made the product possible. MegaMafia made the execution inevitable."_ [Source](https://x.com/tiagovalhalla/status/1915075799364890765)

This represents a broader industry shift away from VC-heavy, low-float models toward genuine community ownership where **innovation thrives**, **barriers crumble**, and the **ecosystem grows together** through collaborative rather than extractive models.

### **Technical Architecture & Innovation**

Valhalla is building the **first fully on-chain hybrid trading platform** that combines perps, spot trading, and lending in a composable environment. [Launch announcement](https://x.com/valhalla_defi/status/1869412418021196030)

**Core Technical Features:**

* **Hybrid execution model** - On-chain settlement with off-chain order matching for optimal performance
* **Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)** - Professional-grade order matching similar to traditional finance
* **Real-time composability** - Sub-100ms execution enabling atomic strategies
* **Yield-bearing collateral** - Support for assets like capUSD from Cap Labs, earning yield while trading
* **Permissionless market creation** - Fast asset listings when sufficient volume/liquidity exists

**Revolutionary Trading Primitives:** ([tweet1](https://x.com/tiagovalhalla/status/1927370862442828125) | [tweet2](https://x.com/valhalla_defi/status/1869412418021196030))

* **Atomic Funding Rate Farming** - Execute spot buy + perp short simultaneously via flash loans, eliminating timing risks and market exposure during strategy setup.
* **Composable Risk Management** - Smart contracts handle positions and risk, enabling other protocols to build on top of Valhalla's infrastructure.
* **Integrated DeFi Strategies** - Close shorts, roll margin into yield vaults, and rebalance collateral within single atomic transactions.
* **Positions as Collateral** - Use P\&L from existing positions to back new trades, maximizing capital efficiency.

### **Competitive Advantages vs. Hyperliquid**

While respecting Hyperliquid's community-building success, Valhalla offers distinct technical advantages:

* **Composability:** Hyperliquid operates across separate environments (HyperEVM vs. HyperCore) with different block speeds (1s vs. 70ms). Precompiles bridge these but create latency. Valhalla maintains **full composability** within MegaETH's unified environment.
* **Latency & Performance:** Hyperliquid's L1 consensus creates latency as validators coordinate globally. MegaETH's **co-located sequencers and oracles** achieve sub-100ms execution by decoupling execution from consensus.
* **Privacy Options:** Unlike transparent order books, Valhalla provides **optionality** - users can choose private or verifiably public trading based on their strategy needs.

**Infrastructure Details:**

* **Oracle system** - Multi-source (A, B, C) with on-chain fallback mechanisms
* **Liquidation engine** - Permissionless participation, vault-assisted liquidations
* **Fee structure** - Tiered by volume, no VIP programs, equal treatment for all users
* **Low gas costs** - MegaETH's efficiency avoids fee spikes common on other chains

As Tiago explains: _"Binance can't do it with their CEX and BNB chain, Hyperliquid can't do it with HyperCore and HyperEVM - Valhalla and MegaETH do it."_ [Source](https://x.com/tiagovalhalla/status/1927370862442828125)
