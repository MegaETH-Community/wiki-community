# Infrastructure

MegaETH solved the slow-chain problem. Next is the slow-infra problem. Oracles, indexers, apps—real-time chains demand innovation on traditional tools before users can _feel_ real-time.

### The Infrastructure Challenge

Traditional blockchain infrastructure assumes multi-second block times:

* **RPCs** poll for receipts every few seconds
* **Indexers** batch process blocks periodically
* **Oracles** update prices on minute intervals
* **Apps** show "pending" states for seconds

With 10ms blocks and instant execution, this infrastructure becomes the bottleneck. Users won't feel real-time performance if the tools can't keep up.

***

### Realtime API

MegaETH's extension to Ethereum JSON-RPC optimized for sub-10ms latency.

**Core Innovation**: Query against mini-blocks, not EVM blocks

* Transactions reflected within 10ms of arrival
* State changes visible immediately
* Full preconfirmation guarantees maintained

**Enhanced Methods**:

* **State queries** (`eth_getBalance`, `eth_call`, etc.):
  * Return results up to most recent mini-block
  * Use `pending` or `latest` tag for real-time data
  * 100x faster state visibility vs waiting for EVM blocks
* **Transaction queries** (`eth_getTransactionReceipt`):
  * See transactions as soon as mini-block includes them
  * No more waiting for next EVM block
  * Receipt available in \~10ms
* **WebSocket subscriptions** (`eth_subscribe`):
  * **Logs**: Stream as transactions execute
  * **State changes**: Monitor account updates in real-time
  * **Fragments**: Subscribe to mini-block stream

**Example timeline**:

* 0ms: Transaction sent
* 10ms: Included in mini-block, visible in Realtime API
* 1000ms: Included in EVM block (traditional visibility)

### realtime\_sendRawTransaction

Revolutionary RPC method that bundles send + receipt in one call.

**Problem it solves**:

* Traditional flow: Send tx → Poll for receipt → Multiple round trips
* Polling wastes time between checks
* Too frequent polling overloads infrastructure
* Like checking mailbox every 10 minutes vs getting notification

**How it works**:

* Send transaction to sequencer
* Sequencer executes immediately (<10ms)
* Returns receipt in same response
* One RPC call for entire flow

**Benefits**:

* **Zero polling overhead**
* **Minimal latency** (network + 10ms execution)
* **Simple integration** (drop-in replacement)
* **Better DevEx** (no subscription management)

**Implementation**:

```json
// Traditional (multiple calls)
1. eth_sendRawTransaction → returns hash
2. eth_getTransactionReceipt (poll) → null
3. eth_getTransactionReceipt (poll) → null
4. eth_getTransactionReceipt (poll) → receipt
// MegaETH (single call)
1. realtime_sendRawTransaction → returns receipt
```

### Paginated Reads

Robust API for processing massive chain data efficiently.

**The data scale problem**:

* MegaETH testnet: 1000 TPS sustained
* Generates 1 year of Ethereum data every 5 days
* Traditional RPCs timeout on large queries
* Apps forced to break queries into tiny chunks

**Pagination solution**:

* **Partial results**: Return what's processed before limits hit
* **Resume pointers**: Continue exactly where query stopped
* **No wasted work**: Every computation counts
* **Optimal round trips**: Minimize network overhead

**Example use case**: Query 1M blocks of logs:

* **Without pagination**:
  * Query fails at 300k blocks
  * Retry with smaller range
  * Start from scratch each time
  * Unreliable, slow, complex
* **With pagination**:
  * First call returns 300k blocks + pointer
  * Second call continues from block 300,001
  * Zero wasted computation
  * Predictable, fast, simple

**Benefits for builders**:

* **Indexers**: Efficient backfilling after downtime
* **Analytics**: Process entire chain history
* **Dashboards**: Load large datasets reliably
* **Infrastructure**: Handle data at scale

### Infrastructure Roadmap

**Current (Testnet)**:

* ✅ Realtime API with mini-block queries
* ✅ realtime\_sendRawTransaction
* ✅ Paginated reads for logs
* ✅ WebSocket subscriptions

**Coming Soon**:

* Extended pagination (traces, state)
* Batch transaction submission
* Priority transaction lanes
* Historical state queries at mini-block level

**Future Vision**:

* Sub-millisecond oracles
* Streaming indexers
* Real-time analytics
* Instant cross-chain messaging

### Builder Resources

**Integration Guides**:

* [Realtime API Docs](https://docs.megaeth.com/realtime-api)
* SDK support coming for major libraries
* Example implementations available

**Best Practices**:

* Use `realtime_sendRawTransaction` for user transactions
* Subscribe to mini-blocks for live data
* Implement pagination for historical queries
* Cache aggressively—data is immutable once confirmed

The infrastructure revolution is just beginning. As MegaETH pushes blockchain performance to new limits, expect innovative tools and services that reimagine what's possible in Web3.
