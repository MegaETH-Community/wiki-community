**Real-time motion graph for the future of movement** - Powering autonomous vehicles and robots with spatial intelligence that constantly evolves. Transform your daily drives into paid mapping contributions that build tomorrow's autonomy stack.

**The Problem**

The era of autonomous everything is approaching - drones, humanoids, self-driving vehicles. But **today's maps were built for humans**, not robots.

Robots don't need:

* Street names or turn-by-turn navigation
* Static, siloed map data updated quarterly

Robots need:

* **Door locations, sidewalk widths, curb heights**
* **Real-time updates** on construction, traffic cones, crowds
* Constantly evolving spatial intelligence

**The Solution**

Cilium leverages the **gig economy** to transform everyday footage into a **real-time, high-resolution spatial intelligence layer**. Everyone drives multiple times a day - why not get paid for mapping the world around you?

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time motion graph** - constantly evolving with every vehicle
* **Open infrastructure** - not siloed like legacy mapping systems
* **Crowdsourced intelligence** - drivers earn while contributing spatial data
* **Built for autonomy** - designed for robots and vehicles, not human navigation

Where legacy maps are static, Cilium is **alive** - learning and adapting with every frame captured.

**Philosophy: Ruthless Pragmatism**

The Cilium team embodies the Mafia doctrine of **unlearning** - willing to let go of existing best practices and venture into uncharted territory. Building for a frontier that doesn't quite exist yet, with the conviction that perception itself will become infrastructure.

_"In a world of autonomous sensory blindness, Cilium lights the path forward. Where vision itself learns to move."_
