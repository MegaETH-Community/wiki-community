**The Problem**

For a generation going increasingly online, **internet connectivity is becoming a critical constant**. Traveling internationally or being somewhere without connection is a massive pain point that only grows worse as our lives move digital.

**The Solution**

Ubitel transforms internet service into a **two-sided value system** where users benefit multiple ways:

**Yield-Bearing Subscriptions:**

* Monthly subscription fees deposited into yielding stablecoin pools
* Generated yield passed back to users, **discounting service costs**
* Internet that pays for itself over time

**Passive Compute Rewards:**

* Unlocks the **passive TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)** in every phone
* Devices provide verifiable compute to the network in the background
* Users earn rewards for contributing compute power
* Hosts and subscribers both participate in network infrastructure

**The Ethos**

Ubitel follows the Mafia 2.0 philosophy of **monetizing everyday activities**. Your phone is already in your pocket - why not earn from it while getting better, cheaper internet?

Open Data markets meet connectivity, creating a new model where subscribers become stakeholders and infrastructure becomes distributed.
