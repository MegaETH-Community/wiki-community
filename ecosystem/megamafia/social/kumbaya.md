**The Vision**

Kumbaya dares builders to **create culture and assign it value in real-time**. By combining coordination games with MegaETH's speed and liquidity, the platform enables cultural movements to form, grow, and be priced as they emerge.

**What We Know**

* **Culture-value flywheel** - the more a culture coordinates, the more value it creates
* **Real-time pricing** - cultural momentum translated into on-chain metrics instantly
* **Coordination games** powered by MegaETH's performance capabilities
* [Described](https://x.com/0xMegaMafia/status/1976326454037315990) as "**the most egalitarian thing**" in crypto, with ambitions to "**reshape the fabric of society**"

_The question isn't whether culture has value - it's whether we can finally price it fairly._
