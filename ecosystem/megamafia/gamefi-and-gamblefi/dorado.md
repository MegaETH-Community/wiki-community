# Dorado

**Trust the code, be the house** - The first fully trustless on-chain gambling platform where LPs fund and become the house. Transparent, verifiable infrastructure that aligns players and liquidity providers in a decentralized protocol.

**The Problem**

Online gambling became accessible but **lost its soul**. The atmosphere vanished - no crowd, no shared moments, just solitary transactions behind a screen. Players fund the system but never own it. They take the risk, the house takes the profit.

Traditional platforms are:

* **Opaque** - black box logic and custodial wallets
* **Centralized** - players never owned what they funded
* **Isolated** - efficient but lonely, transactional but empty

**The Solution**

For the first time, **game logic, randomness, execution, and settlement live entirely on-chain**. No opaque ledgers. No hidden logic. The house runs as a **decentralized protocol** where participation drives value.

**How It Works:**

* **LPs become the house** - fund games and earn a share of the house edge
* **Players drive liquidity** - more play → bigger prize pools → more liquidity → more play
* **Transparent infrastructure** - every outcome is verifiable and secure
* **Aligned incentives** - game-theoretic design around lockups, points, and exclusive jackpots

The player and the house sit on the **same side of the table**. Both roles matter, both are rewarded.

**Philosophy: A World Built, Not Discovered**

El Dorado was never a place - it was a belief that fortune waits beyond what we understand. Dorado begins from a different premise: **fortune isn't hidden, it's made** between people in the risks we share.

Games of chance were always communal acts - moments of suspense shared among strangers. Dorado brings back the spark that online gambling lost, building an **immersive world animated by its community** where every action leaves a permanent trace on-chain.

The search for El Dorado is over. The work of building it has begun.
