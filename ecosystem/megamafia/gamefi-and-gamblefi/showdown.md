### Team & Vision

**The Founders**

**The Mission: Make Card Games Great Again**

_"20 years ago, poker was king. Then Hearthstone took over. Now it's time for the next big thing."_ Showdown aims to resurrect high-stakes competitive gaming by solving poker's modern problems: bots, regulatory fragmentation, and trust issues—all while keeping games fast, strategic, and accessible.

**Core Principles**

* **Game experience first** – No overcomplicated designs
* **Learn in 10 minutes** – Master over thousands of hours
* **Built for competition** – From casual play to million-dollar stakes

### How Showdown Works

**The Gameplay Loop**

Showdown takes poker's foundation and adds TCG mechanics:

* **7-10 minute matches** – Quick, mobile-friendly sessions
* **1v1 heads-up format** – Pure skill-based competition
* **2 private + 5 shared cards** – Classic poker structure
* **Action cards modify outcomes** – Change pocket cards, steal chips, interact with opponents
* **First to 100 chips wins** – Pot starts at 10 chips each hand

**Key Mechanics**

* **Starting Hand** – Get 2 pocket cards + 2 action cards (4 on first hand)
* **Action Card Management** – Keep up to 5 cards that carry over between hands
* **Chip Value System** – Playing action cards adds their chip value to the pot
* **Turn Structure** – Players alternate between playing action cards or checking

**Game Flow**

* **Preflop** → **Flop** (3 community cards) → **Fold Option** → **River** (2 more cards)
* If both players continue after fold option, **pot doubles automatically**
* **Color-coded timing** – Green cards (Preflop), Red (Flop), Blue (River), Grey (any stage)
* **Showdown** – Best 5-card poker hand wins the pot

_"Even if you start with a bad hand, you can play cards to improve it"_ – Unlike poker where you fold 90% of hands, Showdown ensures constant action and engagement.

### Technical Architecture

**Why Blockchain?**

[The founders explain](https://x.com/Mega_Ecosystem/status/1915546328760779000) how blockchain solves poker's biggest issues:

* **Permissionless play** – No country restrictions or regulatory barriers
* **Anti-bot design** – Action cards make algorithmic play impractical
* **Trust through transparency** – Smart contract tournaments with guaranteed payouts
* **True ownership** – NFT cards as collectible skins (gameplay cards free)

**MegaETH Integration**

With MegaETH's performance, Showdown enables:

* **Real-time betting markets** – Predict tournament winners mid-game
* **Instant settlements** – No waiting for withdrawals
* **On-chain tournaments** – Transparent, immutable prize pools
* **Community features** – Player-designed cards with on-chain voting

### Market Positioning

**The Problem with Modern Poker**

* **Banned in many countries** – US players can't face Europeans
* **Bot dominance** – AI beats pros since 2017
* **Trust issues** – Full Tilt's collapse still haunts players
* **Slow gameplay** – Folding 90% of hands kills excitement

**Showdown's Solution**

* **Global accessibility** – Blockchain bypasses regulations
* **Human-centric design** – Action cards defeat algorithmic play
* **Transparent infrastructure** – No custody, no trust required
* **Constant action** – Every hand matters, momentum swings frequently

### The Showdown Thesis

**Two-Sided Market**

* **Casual players** – Climb ladders, collect cards, enjoy quick matches
* **High-stakes players** – Bet millions in ego-driven skill battles
* **Not pay-to-win** – All gameplay cards free, NFTs are cosmetic only

**Competitive Vision**

Drawing from their professional backgrounds, the founders are building:

* **Regular seasons** with transparent rewards
* **eSports infrastructure** for tournaments
