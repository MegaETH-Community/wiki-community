# Rocket

**Call any price. Win from any move.** - Redistribution markets that unlock unlimited position sizes on any price feed with returns that compound with conviction. Transform price speculation from static bets into a dynamic, social, mobile-first experience.

**The Concept**

Most prediction markets are slow by design: "Will this event happen in 3 months?" Lock capital, wait, maybe collect later.

Rocket flips the model. If it has a price, it can be traded - **crypto, stocks, memes, NFTs, even Polymarket odds**. Every opinion becomes a market, every market becomes a game.

**How It's Different**

**Continuous vs. Binary:**

* Traditional prediction markets (Polymarket/Kalshi) = static event bets with **capped upside**
* Rocket = **continuous real-time markets** with **uncapped returns**
* Just as perp DEXs replaced static expiry options, Rocket evolves prediction markets into fluid, always-on infrastructure

**Redistribution Mechanics:**

* When your conviction proves correct while others are positioned opposite, **upside grows proportionally** (10x, 50x+ returns)
* More dynamic, skill-based environment where speculation aligns with how markets actually behave: **fluid, fast, constantly evolving**
* **Instant payouts** powered by MegaETH's real-time settlement

**Building Above, Not Against**

Rocket doesn't compete with Polymarket - it builds a layer above it. Prediction markets become **data sources and infrastructure**, not the end product. Polymarket shows the odds for what might happen; Rocket shows **where those odds are about to move in real-time**.

**The Team**

* [@0xflux\_\_\_](https://x.com/0xflux_) and [@puzzledape](https://x.com/puzzledape) - Built successful products before, created the **#1 Polymarket trading bot** a year ago
* [@nics\_off](https://x.com/nics_off) - Head of Marketing

Every chart becomes tradable. Every move becomes opportunity.
