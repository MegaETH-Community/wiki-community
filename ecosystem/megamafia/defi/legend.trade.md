**The Concept**

Trading is already the world's biggest video game - Legend makes it **multiplayer**.

Competitive gaming taught us that tournaments create primal enjoyment: the thrill of going PvP, reacting under pressure, outsmarting opponents. Gamebattles brought this intensity to a new level for those who thrive in high-stakes scenarios.

**Trading mirrors this perfectly:**

* React calmly during volatile markets
* Use skill, not just capital size, to win
* Outsmart opponents with mental fortitude

Legend combines tournament settings with trading, creating the **competitive-social layer** the space has been missing.

**How It Works**

Legend transforms trading into **ranked competitive battles** where traders face off head-to-head:

* **TvT format** - pit your skills against other traders in real-time
* **Public verification** - prove your abilities in a social setting
* **Skill-based matching** - size doesn't matter, strategy does
* **Tournament structure** - familiar gaming format adapted for markets

For traders who want to prove they're the best, Legend is the arena.
