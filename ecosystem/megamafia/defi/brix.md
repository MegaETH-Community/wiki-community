**The Opportunity**

Many non-USD currencies offer **high yields relative to inflation**, but accessing them is difficult. Brix brings these emerging market currencies on-chain and transforms them into yield-bearing stablecoins.

**First Product: Turkish Lira Stablecoin**

* Currently yielding **\~40% in Lira terms**
* **15-20% vs USD** after accounting for currency depreciation
* Opens access to yields unavailable in traditional DeFi

**DeFi Integration**

Brix introduces high emerging-market yields into DeFi primitives:

* **Looping strategies** for amplified returns
* **Leverage opportunities** on high-yield assets
* **Pendle yield derivatives** and structured products
* Tokens and incentives for participants

**The Risk-Reward Profile**

The catch: **FX rates and yields are volatile and risky**. Emerging markets offer asymmetric returns but require risk tolerance. For those who see the opportunity and want exposure to high-yield currencies previously locked behind geographic barriers, Brix provides on-chain access.

_Risk it to get the biscuit._

Building the future of FX on-chain, brick by brick.
