**The Problem**

Blockspace is abundant, **attention is scarce**. The worst parts of crypto feel like a slot machine you play alone - always-on markets turn consistent FOMO into burnout. You're exhausted from pretending to understand candlestick patterns at 3 AM.

**The Solution**

TENTEN concentrates market action into **daily social events** that focus attention, encouraging coordinated play and shared moments instead of endless vigilance.

**The Philosophy**

Time is the only currency you can't earn back. TENTEN offers:

* **Your new morning routine** - predictable, time-boxed trading windows
* **Efficient decisions** - no pretending to be a full-time trader
* **Social coordination** - shared moments, not isolated gambling
* **Boundaries** - trade at 10:10, live the rest of your day

**The Experience**

Set your alarm. Show up at 10:10. Make your play. Move on with your life.

No cuddles, just profits. Bad decisions made efficiently aren't bad decisions - they're just good stories with better endings.

TENTEN transforms crypto trading from a lifestyle disease into a **profitable quickie** - the commitment to yourself without the actual commitment.

_Your therapist says you need boundaries? Here's your first one._
