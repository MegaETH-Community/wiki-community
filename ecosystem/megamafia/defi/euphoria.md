# Euphoria

**Euphoria transforms crypto derivatives trading into a mobile game-like experience.** One tap to predict price movements. No charts, no order books, no stress – just pure intuition expressed through simple finger gestures.

### Team & Vision

**The Origin Story**

[Nathan Worsley](https://x.com/NathanWorsley_) (CEO), [Casey Craig](https://x.com/gmcaseycraig) (Co-founder & Head of Growth), and their CTO [Johnny](https://x.com/johnnygannon) met at Devcon Bangkok during a philosophy panel where Nathan defended speculation as a learning tool for young traders – [a contrarian take that resonated with Casey](https://x.com/Euphoria_fi/status/1886911706896453830). They discovered shared interests in making derivatives accessible and started building Euphoria shortly after, bringing [DefiDougi](https://x.com/DefiDougi) (ex-Binance) as Head of Community.

**The Mission: "Feel Something"**

_"They made it work. We made it fun."_ – Euphoria rejects the notion that trading must be stressful and complex. While traditional interfaces intimidate with endless charts and confusing lingo, Euphoria brings the dopamine rush of mobile gaming to derivatives trading.

**Traction**

With **300,000+ waitlist signups** pre-launch and notable traders like **Cobie** and **Amir** competing on leaderboards, Euphoria is set to launch on **MegaETH mainnet**.

### How Tap Trading Works

**The Core Innovation**

Euphoria strips derivatives down to their essence: **predictions about the future**. Instead of navigating complex interfaces, users simply:

* **See a price chart** on their phone
* **Tap where they think price will go**
* **Win if price hits their prediction**
* **Compete on leaderboards** with friends

_"If a child can understand how to use your product, then you've built it right"_ – Casey notes that [even Nathan's 8-year-old son could profitably trade](https://x.com/Euphoria_fi/status/1886911706896453830) (with testnet money) using the intuitive interface.

**Key Features**

* **One-tap execution** – No order types, no margin calculations
* **Gamified rewards** – Points, streaks, achievements
* **Social trading** – Share strategies, compete with friends
* **Mobile-first** – Built for the TikTok generation
* **Real money, real markets** – Not a tap-to-earn game, but real derivatives trading

### Technical Architecture

**Why MegaETH**

[Euphoria chose MegaETH](https://x.com/Euphoria_fi/status/1881460876492058640) for its unprecedented performance:

* **Sub-millisecond latency** – Essential for game-like responsiveness
* **100,000+ TPS** – Handles complex swarms of trades
* **10ms blocks** – Instant feedback on every tap
* **Unlimited gas** – Complex payoff calculations in real-time

_"You can't build substantial Web2-speed apps on Web3-speed rails"_ – Traditional chains with seconds-long block times can't deliver the instant gratification Euphoria requires.

**Protocol Design Philosophy**

Unlike platforms that start with protocol design and treat UX as an afterthought, Euphoria began with a simple question: **"What would be the most intuitive and enjoyable trading experience possible?"**

* **Finger gestures first** – Like scrolling Instagram or swiping Tinder
* **Complexity hidden** – Sophisticated market making under the hood
* **Mobile native** – Not a desktop experience crammed onto phones
* **Economically sustainable** – Real markets, not synthetic rewards

### Market Positioning

**Beyond Tap-to-Earn**

[Euphoria explains why tap-to-earn failed](https://x.com/Euphoria_fi/status/1889385835478602048):

* **Tap-to-earn** creates artificial economies with no real value
* **Tap Trading** connects to existing market dynamics
* Like the difference between a slot machine and a piano – one extracts value, the other enables expression

**Target Audience**

* **Primary:** The "crypto-curious" who find Hyperliquid too complex
* **Secondary:** Crypto natives seeking a fun, mobile trading experience
* **Vision:** Make derivatives as accessible as Robinhood made options

### The Euphoria Thesis

**Core Beliefs:**

* If trading is **fun**, more people will trade
* If trading is **intuitive**, more people will learn
* If trading is **social**, more people will connect
* If trading **feels good**, more people will thrive

_"Hyper-speculation isn't a problem to solve; it's a design challenge to optimize"_

**Post-AGI Vision**

The team presents a thought-provoking thesis: In a post-AGI world where AI handles all economic activity, [hyper-gambling might become the ultimate form of social mobility](https://x.com/Euphoria_fi/status/1886911706896453830) – the only way to break out of the UBI class into wealth.

**The Bottom Line:** Euphoria isn't trying to build a better trading terminal – they're reimagining what trading can be. By turning price predictions into simple taps and market dynamics into social games, they're creating the first trading platform built for how the next generation wants to interact with markets: **playful, mobile, and deeply human**.
