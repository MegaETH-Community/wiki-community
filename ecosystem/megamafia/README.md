**MegaMafia 2.0** → Broader scope, deeper creativity. Challenge builders to imagine product spaces outside conventional thinking - apps that **formalize existing loops instead of manufacturing new demand**, taking fragmented day-to-day behaviors and distilling them into coherent flows that unlock new connections
