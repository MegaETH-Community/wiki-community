# CAP

[CAP](https://x.com/MacroMate8/status/1958625089668386992) is building the first **stablecoin protocol that outsources yield generation** in a programmatically secure manner, combining verifiable smart contracts with economically enforced guarantees through shared security networks.

### Vision & Team

CAP introduces a paradigm shift in stablecoins – moving from centralized "hedge fund" models to **decentralized, market-driven yield generation** with credible financial guarantees. The protocol operates on two core principles:

* **Open protocols** – Autonomous systems foster innovation and transparency through verifiable code
* **Market driven** – Well-designed incentives minimize human judgment and maximize efficiency

**Core Products:**

* **cUSD** – A unified digital dollar backed by regulated stablecoins (USDC, USDT, pyUSD, BUIDL), providing "singleness of money" across fragmented stablecoin ecosystem
* **stcUSD** – Yield-bearing version earned by staking cUSD, with returns generated by a competitive network of professional operators

As [Ultra notes](https://x.com/0x_ultra/status/1909260677740703813): "CAP is building the natural evolution for stables, where every aspect is decentralized – even the yield generation (both on and off chain)."

**Team & Backing:** CAP combines **institutional finance expertise** with deep crypto-native understanding, [backed by](https://cryptorank.io/ico/cap):

* **$1.1M community round** via Echo (Omega, Patrons, Crab Notes, Price Club)
* **1.9M Pre-Seed and $8.0M Seed round** with participation from MegaMafia founders

Led by [Benjamin](https://x.com/Benjamin918_) (founder) and [DeFiDave](https://x.com/DeFiDave22) (Head of Growth), the team maintains active presence across [Community Forum](https://capcommunity.discourse.group/) for discussions and collaborates regularly with MegaETH core team and Vitalik as advisor.

### MegaETH Integration

As a founding member of the [MegaMafia](https://x.com/0xMegaMafia), CAP will serve as **the native stablecoin engine for MegaETH**:

* **Issuance layer** – Mint capUSD on Ethereum, use natively across MegaETH
* **Instant settlement** – Leverage real-time blockchain for immediate yield allocation
* **Deep integration** – CAP stablecoins as default primitive across MegaETH DeFi

[The announcement](https://x.com/capmoney_/status/1909239508291166343): "As part of MegaMafia, Cap will focus its growth and usage on MegaETH – the world's first real-time blockchain."

### How CAP Works

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x83c21bb4Bf0EC116f5a1945AaeF847Fe3b321B32/-Fw6wiyvnSV5aOYeKhaADvEqXdwngJfWMfZJuFv6iA4">What is CAP: A Gentle Introduction to cUSD</a></p></figcaption></figure>

CAP creates a **three-sided marketplace** that aligns incentives across all participants:

**1. Minters (Stablecoin Holders)**

* Deposit USDC/USDT to mint cUSD 1:1
* Always fully redeemable for underlying collateral
* Can stake to stcUSD for yield or use cUSD as payment

**2. Operators (Yield Generators)**

* **Whitelisted institutions** – banks, HFT firms, market makers, RWA protocols | [Day1 Whitelisted](https://x.com/capmoney_/status/1955993761999413732)
* Borrow protocol assets to execute yield strategies
* Keep profits above CAP's benchmark yield (e.g., if benchmark is 13% and they earn 40%, they keep 27%)
* Must secure delegations from restakers to access capital

**3. Restakers (Security Providers)**

* Delegate staked ETH via EigenLayer to underwrite operators
* Earn premiums from operators based on risk assessment
* Subject to slashing if operators fail to meet obligations
* Create verifiable downside protection for users

**4. Liquidators**

* Execute permissionless Dutch auctions when positions become undercollateralized
* Earn liquidation bonuses for maintaining protocol health
* Ensure stablecoin holders remain protected at all times

[Benjamin explains](https://x.com/0xyanshu/status/1924477538811986136): Like Uber doesn't own vehicles and Airbnb doesn't own rooms, CAP doesn't execute yield strategies – it creates the marketplace for others to do so efficiently.

### Revolutionary Design

#### **Type III Stablecoin Architecture**

CAP represents the evolution beyond [existing models](https://x.com/capmoney_/status/1929919466818637987):

* **Type 0** – Endogenous yield (CDPs, leverage-based)
* **Type I** – Team-run strategies (Celsius-style)
* **Type II** – DAO-managed yield (governance bottlenecks)
* **Type III** – Smart contract-enforced rules with economic guarantees

**Key Innovations:**

* **Zero-collateral lending** for operators – Like extended flash loans with multi-day windows
* **Perpetual competitive yield** – Market dynamics ensure optimal returns across all conditions
* **Verifiable protection** – All guarantees transparent and enforceable on-chain
* **Strategy agnostic** – Works with DeFi arbitrage, RWAs, market making, any yield source

#### **Shared Security Integration**

CAP pioneers using [EigenLayer](https://x.com/eigenlayer/status/1927782535821431152) for **productivity-based rewards** rather than passive validation:

* **Economic underwriting** – Restakers' capital directly backs operator activities
* **Automatic slashing** – Protocol enforces penalties for defaults or violations
* **Isolated risk pools** – Only CAP-specific delegations at risk, not broader EigenLayer network
* **Regulated counterparties** – Operators enter legal agreements with restakers

This creates what the team calls a **"trust marketplace"** – capital doesn't just validate, it underwrites productive financial activity.

### Technical Architecture

#### **Smart Contract Design**

CAP's contracts enforce **immutable rules** for all participants:

* **Hurdle rates** – Minimum acceptable yields filter suboptimal operators
* **Delegation limits** – Prevent concentration risk
* **Overcollateralization ratios** – Conservative thresholds for each collateral type
* **Autonomous slashing** – Objective conditions trigger penalties without governance

#### **Operator Mechanics**

The protocol creates a **competitive lending marketplace**:

* Separate markets for each collateral asset (USDC, USDT, etc.)
* Operators submit bids with loan amount and expected returns
* Smart contracts allocate to highest-yielding qualified bids
* No human discretion in capital allocation

#### **Risk Management**

Multiple layers ensure user protection:

* **Whitelisted operators** – Only regulated institutions with legal agreements
* **Blue-chip collateral** – ETH, wBTC, LSTs, and stablecoins only
* **Buffer periods** – Prevent accidental delegation withdrawals
* **Transparent coverage** – Users can verify protection levels on-chain
* **Oracle protection** – 0.25% mint/burn fees during pilot phase
* **Dynamic hurdle rates** – Market rate floor + utilization-based adjustments
* **Liquidity guarantees** – Sharp rate increases ensure withdrawal availability

#### **Example: How stcUSD Works -** [**Source**](https://docs.cap.app/protocol-overview/stcusd-mechanics)

**Happy Path - Yield Distribution:**

1. Alice deposits $100 USDC to mint 100 cUSD, then stakes for 100 stcUSD
2. An operator identifies opportunity above CAP's 8% hurdle rate
3. Operator secures delegation from restaker and borrows the USDC
4. Operator generates 15% yield and repays loan
5. **Distribution**: 8% to stcUSD holders, 2% to restakers, 5% operator profit

**Protection Path - Slashing:**\
If operator defaults or collateral value drops:

* Dutch auction automatically triggers
* Liquidators purchase slashed restaker collateral at discount
* Proceeds restore reserves, keeping stcUSD holders whole

#### **Idle Capital Management**

**Fractional Reserves:**

* Unborrowed assets automatically earn yield via underlying protocols (Aave, Morpho)
* ERC4626 vaults manage each asset independently
* Programmatic allocation based on best available rates
* Instant divestment when needed for withdrawals or new loans

**The Bottom Line:** CAP transforms stablecoins from static assets into **actively productive instruments** by creating an open marketplace where the world's best yield generators compete to serve users, all backed by verifiable economic guarantees. This isn't just another yield wrapper – it's the infrastructure for sustainable, scalable DeFi yield at institutional scale.
