# Noise

**Noise transforms attention into a tradable asset.** Instead of speculating on token prices, users long or short mindshare—betting directly on what people are talking about. A platform that makes trading trends as simple as scrolling your feed.

[Website](https://noise.xyz/) | [Twitter](https://x.com/noise_xyz)

### Team & Vision

**The Founders**

* [lucacs](https://x.com/lucacseth) – Building Noise from first principles
* [gabo](https://x.com/notgabo) – Leading product and design

Based in NYC with a 6-person team working fully in-person, Noise Labs operates with three core values: **Build in the Unknown**, **The Best Products Teach People What They Want**, and **No Passengers**—everyone ships code, designs, or talks to users.

**The Mission: Make Attention Tradable**

_"People trade what they understand: attention"_ – Noise recognizes that attention is life's most valuable currency. By partnering with [KaitoAI](https://x.com/noise_xyz/status/1906710881674629209) to measure mindshare across thousands of sources, they're creating the first platform where you can trade trends themselves, not just the assets beneath them.

### How Noise Works

**The Core Concept**

Noise lets you speculate on relative attention—what percentage of crypto Twitter is talking about a project:

* **Real-time mindshare data** – Prices update every second via Kaito
* **Up to 5x leverage** – Amplify your bets on trending topics
* **No expiry dates** – Markets stay open as long as attention exists
* **Simple mechanics** – If chatter increases, trend pumps; if buzz fades, it dumps

**Current Markets**

In testnet V1, users can trade pre-TGE crypto projects like:

* Monad
* Farcaster
* Abstract
* And 10+ other trending protocols

Future versions will expand beyond crypto into music, culture, politics—anywhere attention flows.

### Technical Architecture

**Why MegaETH**

[Noise functions like a perpetual futures exchange for cultural indices](https://x.com/megaeth_labs/status/1910370982868770889), requiring the same real-time capabilities as traditional exchanges:

* **High-throughput CLOB** – Process Kaito's mindshare metrics into tradable derivatives
* **Ultra-low latency** – Turn cultural data into instant trading opportunities
* **Web2-like experience** – Make trading mindshare feel as snappy as scrolling Twitter
* **Real-time updates** – Stream price data every second without lag

_"MegaETH's response times deliver the seamless experience of a Web2 trading app"_ – Essential for making cultural trading feel instant and intuitive.

### Market Performance

**Beta Launch Results**

[As reported by simononchain](https://x.com/simononchain/status/1915834434911408345), Noise's invite-only beta (April 1st) delivered impressive metrics:

* **82% of users** placed first trade within 24 hours
* **63% retention** next day
* **22 minutes** average session length
* **$112M simulated volume** from 250 users
* **$375K theoretical fees** generated

No points, no airdrops, no yield farming—just pure product engagement.

### The Noise Thesis

**Mindshare > Tokenization**

While crypto defaults to "tokenize everything," Noise takes the opposite approach:

* **Fragmented liquidity problem** – Too many tokens, not enough depth
* **Better UX for normies** – No rugs, unlocks, or bundled launches
* **Clearer directional bets** – Trade "AI narrative" directly vs picking $GOAT

_"Attention is scarce. Tokens aren't."_ – This model creates more sustainable speculation cycles.

**Expansion Vision**

Starting with crypto as a testbed, not the endgame:

* **Chartmetric integration** – Artist popularity markets
* **Google Trends** – Cultural cycle trading
* **Politics & influencers** – Any trending topic becomes tradable

### Challenges & Solutions

**Oracle Integrity**

* **Current:** Kaito weights smart account engagement, filtering spam
* **Risk:** Coordinated shilling from respected accounts
* **Solution:** Moving to PnL-based funding rates + market pricing mechanics

**Transparency**

* **Current:** Kaito scoring mechanics kept opaque
* **Future:** Documentation needed for real capital deployment

***

**The Bottom Line:** Noise isn't building another DEX or memecoin casino—they're creating the first market for attention itself. By letting users trade mindshare instead of tokens, they've built something genuinely sticky that could break out of crypto entirely. Like Polymarket brought prediction markets mainstream, Noise could do the same for trading cultural trends.
