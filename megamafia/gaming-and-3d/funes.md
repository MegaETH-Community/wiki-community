# Funes

Funes is **an online museum** that creates a vast, free, and accessible 3D database of human constructions. Like Wikipedia has compiled entries of human knowledge, Funes collects high-quality models of buildings through crowd-sourced photogrammetry.

**Core Mission:**

* **Capture and preserve** humanity's architectural heritage
* **Create the largest 3D model database** ever assembled
* **Enable global exploration** through immersive virtual experiences
* **Pass on our tangible world** to the next generation

### How It Works

Funes transforms physical structures into digital heritage through a simple process:

**The Digitization Process:**

1. **Users photograph buildings** from multiple angles
2. **AI automatically converts** images into detailed 3D models
3. **Models are added** to Funes' decentralized archive
4. **Content becomes accessible** for research, education, and exploration

**Key Features:**

* **Crowd-sourced photogrammetry** - Community-driven collection
* **Blockchain verification** - Metadata recorded on-chain
* **Decentralized storage** - Preserved beyond physical limitations
* **Free accessibility** - Open for everyone to enjoy and marvel

### Why It Matters

**Preserving History:**

* **Beyond physical limitations** - Architectural masterpieces facing degradation or destruction are immortalized digitally
* **Material memories** - Preserving our tangible world for future generations
* **Cultural preservation** - Safeguarding humanity's built heritage

**Education & Research:**

* **Virtual reality exploration** - Study models in immersive environments
* **Historical education** - Enhanced learning through 3D visualization
* **Architectural research** - Detailed models for academic study
* **Global accessibility** - Available to anyone, anywhere

**Blockchain Benefits:**

* **Authenticity guaranteed** - Verified metadata on-chain
* **Contributor attribution** - Transparent recognition system
* **Trustless preservation** - Decentralized, tamper-proof archive
* **Permanent record** - Immutable documentation of heritage

### Current Scope & Future Vision

**Current Focus:**

* Architectural structures
* Building preservation
* High-quality 3D models
* Community contributions

**Future Expansion:**

* Broader human creations
